<p>W. C. Davis  grew up like most millennials. They've used record players, cassette tapes, cds, limewire, and iPods, they took cursive and keyboard classes, and they've marveled at the graphics of SNES with as much enthusiasm as the PS4. After spending 11 years post high school working, gaming, and learning new things in the hopes of finding the one thing that would make a fulfilling career, W. C. realized how much coding and code editing they were doing. Fixing small game glitches, personalizing social media, and assisting small businesses with website edits. After two years of using various free videos and books to  learn Python and Javascript, W. C. decided to officially make moves toward pursuing coding as a career they'd enjoy. </p>
